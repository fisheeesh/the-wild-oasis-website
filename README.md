# The Wild Oasis – Hotel Reservation Website

The Wild Oasis is a hotel reservation website where guests can easily browse available cabins, book a reservation, and manage their own bookings. The system ensures that users can only edit or delete **their own reservations**, and past bookings are locked from changes. 

> **Payment is handled at the hotel upon arrival.**

Authentication is secured with **Google Sign-In** via **NextAuth.js**. Logged-in guests can also update their personal information such as **nationality** and **national ID**.
